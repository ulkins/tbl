                                <li><i>Microfinance institution</i>: if loan is smaller than $ 10,000 at origination;</li>

 -                    <ol>
 -                        <li><b>Create initial values</b> using the MSME Country Indicators by IFC and World Bank.</li>
 -                        <li><b>Conduct country deep-dives</b> to refine the data for 25 countries, using local government sources, literature review, and additional research and insights from McKinsey and client experts.</li>
 -                        <li><b>Adjust country-level data to manage varying definitions of SMEs.</b> Whenever national definitions deviate from the MSME definitions given above, adjust the data to fit the common SME definition given above.</li>
 -                        <li><b>Estimate the very small segment</b> which is not usually defined by national data sources. The size of the very small segment—based on the number of enterprises with less than 10 employees—is calculated using data from Brazil, India, Kenya and Mexico, as a percentage of the total. This is then used as an estimate for the rest of the countries.</li>
 -                        <li><b>Extrapolate data</b> for those countries for which data were not available in the MSME Country Indicators by using regional averages for the ratios of micro enterprises to total population, very small enterprises to total population, small enterprises to total population, and medium enterprises to total population.</li>
