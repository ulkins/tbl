                <h2>ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY</h2>
                 <div>
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <div>Lack of access to financial services is a key barrier to the growth for micro, small, medium enterprises (MSMEs).IFC is working to develop solutions to close the MSME financing gap in collaboration with financial institutions (FIs) around the world. By partnering with many types of financial intermediaries, including microfinance institutions (MFIs), commercial banks, leasing companies, and private equity funds, IFC reaches many more small and medium enterprises (SMEs) than it could directly. </div>
