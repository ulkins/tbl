                        <li><b>Adjust country-level data to manage varying definitions of SMEs.</b> Whenever national definitions deviate from the MSME definitions given above, adjust the data to fit the common SME definition given above.</li>

The size of the very small segment—based on the number of enterprises with less than 10 employees—is calculated using data from Brazil, India, Kenya and Mexico, as a percentage of the total.

                        <li><b>Extrapolate data</b> for those countries for which data were not available in the MSME Country Indicators by using regional averages for the ratios of micro enterprises to total population, very small enterprises to total population, small enterprises to total population, and medium enterprises to total population.</li>

                    </ol>

                <h2>Estimating the value of the credit gap:</h2>
                <div>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Estimate average revenues of formal SMEs by using the average revenue data</b> from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys for the countries where that information was available. For other countries, estimate average revenue of the “small” segment by using a linear regression of revenues to GDP per capita. Average revenues for the other segments (i.e., micro, very small, and medium, informal) are based on the regional averages from Enterprise Surveys as GDP per capita was not statistically significant in explaining the variation in revenues in these sectors.</li>
                        <li><b>Establish a baseline of the value of formal credit currently used</b> by using “Global Banking Profit Pools” database by McKinsey & Co., which has estimates of the amount of formal financing provided to formal SMEs in 78 countries and for each region. This dataset includes bank loans, overdrafts, formal trade finance, leasing, and factoring.Combining this database and the average revenue estimates, we estimated average credit usage among SMEs using formal credit as a percentage of their revenues. Note that Enterprise Surveys data does not include trade finance, leasing, and factoring, and this may lead to a potential bias in the estimates due to measurement error. However, the share of these three in overall firm finance is very low, and hence this error is expected to be very small.</li>
                        <li><b>Assume the total potential need for formal financing</b> is 20% of revenues for all institutions that were well-served, unserved and under-served. This assumption is based on interviews with IFC experts, and is verified by an analysis of McKinsey & Co. proprietary data on credit usage of 500 leading emerging-market listed companies.</li>
                        <li><b>Estimate the credit gap</b> on a country-by-country basis as:

                <ol>
                    <li>All MSMEs are assumed to possibly benefit from a deposit account, allowing for the possibility that some MSMEs would not have any need.</li>
                    <li><b>Calculate deposits as a percentage of revenue for those enterprises that already have deposit accounts</b> using the Global Banking Pools database of McKinsey & Co. on deposit volumes for formal SMEs to calculate the average size of deposits for a formal SME as a percentage of average revenue. This is then used for all MSMEs to estimate the total size of current MSME (formal and informal) deposits. Where there was no country-level data, regional averages are used.</li>
                    <li><b>Estimate the total value of un-intermediated cash balances</b> by using the ratio of deposit balances to average revenues for those enterprises with deposit accounts as a proxy for un-intermediated cash balances for enterprises without accounts on a country-by-country basis.

(While Mexico and South Africa data include only employment in informal, non-agricultural enterprises, India data do not.)

                            <li>Using local data from India, the average number of employees of an informal enterprise is estimated as 2 people in South Asia.</li>
                            <li>All informal employees of informal enterprises are then divided by 2 to arrive at the number of informal MSMEs in South Asia.</li>
                            <li>In other regions, the estimate of how many people work in each informal enterprise is adjusted from 2 to 1.7 based on the number of people who are self-employed (using data from the 2002 ILO paper cited above). For example, in India, 52% of people outside of the agricultural sector are self-employed, while the Latin America figure is estimated at 60%. We created a ratio of the percent of self-employment in India over the amount in Latin America, and we multiplied this ratio by 2 (the number of people per informal enterprise in India) to estimate that there are 1.7 people per informal enterprise in Latin America. We repeated this for the other regions, using the India data as our base.</li>

                                    <li><b>Formal microenterprises:</b> Using data on the 14 countries for which data were available, the ratio of average revenues of microenterprises to the average revenue of very small enterprises was calculated for each country.

                                    <li><b>Informal MSMEs:</b> Again using data on the same 14 countries, the ratio average revenues of informal MSMEs to formal MSMEs was calculated for each country.

                            <li><b>Establish a baseline of the value of formal credit currently used by extrapolating from data on formal SMEs with 5 or more employees:</b> Using the ratio of formal MSMEs credit to formal MSMEs revenues, we multiplied average revenues for enterprises with credit in both segments (i.e. formal micro and all informal) by this ratio to estimate their total current usage of credit. The result gives a baseline assessment of the value of formal credit being used for each segment of enterprises in each region.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li><b>The purpose of the analysis and the reports</b>, including the 2010 "Two Trillion and Counting" publication, was to have a practical approach to estimate the gap for credit in developing countries in the MSME sector at the global and regional level using a limited set of resources and data which were available at the time. The main data sources include: (1) National statistical agencies (used to derive the number of MSMEs in developing countries); (2) the World Bank Enterprise Surveys (used to estimate the number of firms expressing that access to finance is an operational constraint for their business, as well as the % of firms that are well served, underserved, and that do not need credit); and (3) the "Global Banking Profit Pools" database by McKinsey & Co. (used to estimate the amount of formal financing provided to formal SMEs in 78 countries across regions). </li>
                    <li><b>The study does not imply that the credit gap can be or should be closed immediately</b>, but instead points out to the necessary improvements, including those in the enabling environment, for this to happen. </li>
                    <li><b>The methodology was specifically developed to estimate the global and regional MSME credit gap</b> (formal and informal) to the extent possible, and hence, the predictions at country level should be interpreted with caution.</li>
                    <li><b> an ideal scenario with better data at both the firm and financial institution level that are comparable across countries and over time</b>, detailed information on the growth opportunities and productivity measures of each of the surveyed enterprises as well as the quantity of credit demanded compared to the availability of credit at different prices would have been useful to conduct a demand estimation. However, it is common that MSMEs do not have proper bookkeeping, or no proper accounting records, due to a variety of reasons. Therefore, it may not be feasible to quantify their unmet credit demand based on their commercially viable projects.</li>
                    <li><b>Given the data limitations, IFC decided to undertake a 'best estimate' analysis</b> using a set of assumptions which included: (i) the use of fixed ratios to estimate the total potential need for formal financing which were conservative in nature; (ii) static firm size distributions and populations (given the already limited availability of such data at the country level); and (iii) taking the credit supply as fixed. </li>
                    <li><b>The fixed ratios mentioned above to determine the total potential need for formal financing</b> were discussed with various industry experts and were verified by McKinsey &Co. using proprietary data on credit usage for 500 leading Emerging Market listed companies.</li>
